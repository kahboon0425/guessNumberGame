# Guess Number Game
This is an interesting game created by react native. The game allows the user to first key-in a number and the phone will guess the number. The user will able to tell if the phone's guess is higher or lower than the number they set. The game is also able to tell if the user is lying. Only until the phone guesses the correct value will the game end.
